## User Stories

- MVP

1. As a user I want to be able to search for any of the three: videos, books, news so that I can create collections using a good variety of content.
2. As a user, I want to be able to search for articles by News or Research so that I can hone in on the type of article I want to read.
3. As a user I want to see videos associated with my article search so that I can explore readily available audiovisual content to enhance the text content of my search. I do not want videos to be displayed with my book searches because I am not searching about current events or research topics which are enhanced by audiovisual content.
4. As a user I want to see an informational message if there are no results for my search so that I can be aware that I need to try using different search terms.
5. As a user I want to see a spinner for loading while my search is being performed so that I am aware that progress is being made if the search is taking a long time to complete.

- Post MVP

6. As a user I want to be able to register and login so that I can save my search results to collections.
7. As a user I want the fonts and colors I see to be consistent so that I am not distracted.
8. As a user I want the menus I want the design of my search applicaiton be stylish so that I am able to enjoy navigating the application and engaging with the content returned by search.
9. As a user I want to be shown a message indicating that I have not selected a search type if I run a search before selecting what type of content I want returned so that I am aware why no results appear and am able to quickly resolve the issue by selecting a return type.

## Challenges

- Refactoring to separate the front end and back ends
- Not running out of API calls
- Refactoring the GoodReads API call from XML to JSON
-

### Authentication

- When a user attempts to log in, our login function is called. It is a global function from auth context.
- The Login function makes a post request to an authentication API. On the backend this will check if username and password exists. If either username or password is incorrect an alert is triggered. Alerts are handled by our Alert Context.
- After successful authentication a JSON Web Token is put in local-storage so the user can stay logged in as they navigate and use the application.

- Authentication Challenge Code Snippet

```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(AuthReducer, initialState);

  // Load User

  const loadUser = async () => {
    if (localStorage.token) {
      setAuthToken(localStorage.token);
    }
    try {
      const res = await axios.get("/api/auth");
      dispatch({
        type: USER_LOADED,
        payload: res.data,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      dispatch({ type: AUTH_ERROR });
    }
  };
```

### Git Workflow

- During the first 3 days of working on the project as we built the application structure and were making significant changes as we finalized our design, we ran into merge conflicts using Git. We resolved these conflicts by screensharing and communicating changes in Slack so that we were sure our repository held the correct code, and that all group members were working off the same version. Slack communication when making pull requests was particularly useful in ensuring that all members knew when to pull the latest version.

## Possibilities for Future

- Paid subscription that allows research articles to be returned by subscription scholarly article services
- Ability to publish collections for other users to explore
- Greater personalization of profile -- avatar, email address, content preferences, etc.
- Creating your own Collection Types
- Optimizing for Mobile Navigation
